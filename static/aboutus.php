  <p>Long Technical, Co. was originally established in 2000
    as a New Year's Resolution by an 11-year old PC Technician in training,
	with the purpose of bringing quality on-site PC repair at a low cost to
	the Greater Spokane Area. Over 10 years later, Long Technical has grown
	into a full-fledged computer consulting firm, providing services to the
	Greater Spokane Area, exactly as envisioned over a decade ago.
  </p>
  <p>Long Technical was designed to be a one-stop computer
    shop. That being said, we provide services for all sectors of the
	computer industry, including (but not limited to):
  </p>

    <li>Data backup and recovery</li>
    <li>Network administration</li>
