# PCP - Custom Shell Environment

### Posted by Jarren Long at 2013-11-26 01:02:34

PCP was designed in 2011 to prove to a professor that Ruby on Rails was not as special as he made it seem; and could be duplicated in C# with satisfactory performance compared to the "rails" command. 20 hours later, I had developed a custom shell framework with built-in "Autodoc" technology (provides dynamic help topics inside command prompt), that was capable of generating a simple Ruby on Rails website, in about half the time that the "rails" command took. While it was a project of spite, the end result was a flexible shell console API (PCPAPI) that could be used to add a custom command line processor to any application in minutes.
